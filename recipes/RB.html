    <p id="og">Traditionally cooked on Mondays <em>Red Beans and Rice</em> was brought to Louisiana after refugees fleeing the Haitian Revolution in 1804 and doubled the city of New Orleans' population. Inspired by French,African,and Spanish cuisine to name a few, red beans and rice was the legendary jazz musician Louis Armstrong's favorite dish and one of mine as well. This will be my iteration of the dish passed down through generations to me. Personally I prefer to add some spice such as Tony Chacere's and top it off with a few drops of Tabasco Sauce but this is a recipe everyone can enjoy and if you would like to add seasoning to yours, go ahead! </p>
