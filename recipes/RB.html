        <li>Add about 4 cups of water into an 8qt stew pot along with minced vegetables and soaked beans. </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Cook for approx 2.5 hours (covered) stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Slice andouille sausage into small circles,then half.</li>
