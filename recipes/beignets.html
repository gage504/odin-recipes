    <p>A confection made famous by Cafe du Monde in the French Market in New Orleans. Everytime I go out west everyone always asks me to make beignets, which I do not mind but it can be rather time consuming because of this I have a quick beignet recipe that everyone loves and is infact how we made ours growing up. It is very simple and can be fun for the whole family.</p>
